## FoneNotes - Fun with Fonenodes

This is a demo project based on the fonenodes api and uses the simple PHP Wrapper provided by Fonenodes at https://github.com/fonenode

To setup the project on windows, simply download the project copy to folder and run the following commands:

1. php artisan migrate
2. php artisan serve

You should be able to see the project life on http://localhost:8000

Note that the mail functions such as the one in Forgot Password and the FoneNode recorded voice demo won't work unless installed on a live server
